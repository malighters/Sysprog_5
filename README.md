# Arithmetic Parser

## Description
This project is an arithmetic parser developed using PLY (Python Lex-Yacc). It is capable of parsing and computing both simple and complex arithmetic expressions, providing a powerful tool for mathematical computations.

## Features 
- **Support for Basic Operations**: Addition (`+`), subtraction (`-`), multiplication (`*`), and division (`/`).
- **Advanced Operations**: Exponentiation (`^`).
- **Variable Support**: Ability to use variables for storing intermediate results.
- **Flexible Grammar**: Uses context-free grammar for parsing expressions.
- **Interactive Mode**: Input and compute expressions in real-time.
- **Multiple operations simultaneously**: Divides operations written through comma(,)

## How to Use ðŸš€
Simply run `main.py` and enter an arithmetic expression. Examples:
- `2 + 3 * 4`
- `x = 5`
- `y = (x + 15)^4`
- `x = 2, y = 2 * x`
